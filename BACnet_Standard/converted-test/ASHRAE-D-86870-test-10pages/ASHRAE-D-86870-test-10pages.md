#### **SPECIAL NOTE**

This Guideline was developed under the auspices of ASHRAE. ASHRAE Guidelines are developed under a review process, identifying a Guideline for the design, testing, application, or evaluation of a specific product, concept, or practice. As a Guideline it is not definitive but encompasses areas where there may be a variety of approaches, none of which must be precisely correct. ASHRAE Guidelines are written to assist professionals in the area of concern and expertise of ASHRAE's Technical Committees and Task Groups.

ASHRAE Guidelines are prepared by Project Committees appointed specifically for the purpose of writing Guidelines. The Project Committee Chair and Vice-Chair must be members of ASHRAE; while other committee members may or may not be ASHRAE members, all must be technically qualified in the subject area of the Guideline.

Development of ASHRAE Guidelines follows procedures similar to those for ASHRAE Standards except that (a) committee balance is desired but not required, (b) an effort is made to achieve consensus but consensus is not required, (c) Guidelines are not appealable, and (d) Guidelines are not submitted to ANSI for approval.

The Senior Manager of Standards of ASHRAE should be contacted for

- a. interpretation of the contents of this Guideline,
- b. participation in the next review of the Guideline,
- c. offering constructive criticism for improving the Guideline, or
- d. permission to reprint portions of the Guideline.

#### <span id="page-4-0"></span>**FOREWORD**

*This guideline establishes a set of standardized advanced sequences of operation for common HVAC systems. Standardized advanced control sequences provide the following benefits:*

- *Reduced engineering time. Rather than develop sequences themselves, design engineers can adapt existing standard sequences that have been proven to perform.*
- *Reduced programming and commissioning time for contractors.*
- *Reduced energy consumption by making systems less dependent on proper implementation and commissioning of control sequences.*
- *Reduced energy consumption by ensuring that proven, cost-effective strategies, including those required by ASHRAE standards and building codes, are fully implemented.*
- *Improved indoor air quality by ensuring control sequences are in compliance with IAQ standards and codes such as ASHRAE Standard 62.1.*
- *Reduced energy consumption and reduced system down-time by including diagnostic software to detect and diagnose system faults and make operators aware of them before they cause performance problems.*

*The intended audience for the guideline includes HVAC designers, control contractors, commissioning agents, and building owners, operators, and maintenance technicians.* 

*This document falls under ASHRAE's continuous maintenance process. For more information, visit ASHRAE's website, or refer to the forms at the end of the guideline.*

*Note section numbers down to 3 rd level, e.g., Section 5.1.2, will not change as addenda are developed, allowing people to reference those sections without concern they will be renumbered in the future.*

#### **Note on Format**

This guideline includes two kinds of informative notes:

**Notes in bold between thick lines provide direction to the editor of these sequences so that they are properly implemented (e.g., identifying mutually exclusive options).** 

*Notes in italics between thin lines provide guidance or additional information about specific sequences.* 

*These notes are not a part of this guideline. They are merely informative and do not contain requirements necessary for conformance to the guideline.*

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**1. PURPOSE**

The purpose of this guideline is to provide uniform sequences of operation for heating, ventilating, and airconditioning (HVAC) systems that are intended to maximize HVAC system energy efficiency and performance, provide control stability, and allow for real-time fault detection and diagnostics.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**2. SCOPE**

- <span id="page-4-3"></span>This guideline provides detailed sequences of operation for HVAC systems.
- <span id="page-4-4"></span>This guideline describes functional tests that, when performed, will confirm implementation of the sequences of operation.

#### <span id="page-4-5"></span>**3. SETPOINTS, DESIGN AND FIELD DETERMINED**

<span id="page-4-6"></span>Information Provided by Designer

**The design setpoints listed in this section must be scheduled in design documents for each zone and air handler by the design engineer.**

#### 3.1.1. General Zone Information

#### 3.1.1.1. Zone Temperature Setpoints

*Zone temperature initial setpoints can be specified by the designer in a number of ways. The most flexible way is to include them for each zone in variable-air-volume (VAV) box and single-zone VAV (SZVAV) air-handling unit (AHU) equipment schedules. They can also be generically listed by zone type, such as the example in (a) below.*

a. Default setpoints shall be based on zone type as shown in Table 3.1.1.1.

#### 3.1.1.2. Outdoor Air Ventilation Setpoints

*Ventilation setpoints can be specified by the designer in a number of ways. The most flexible is to include them for each zone in VAV box and single-zone (SZ) equipment schedules.*

**The engineer must select between ventilation logic options:**

**If the project is to comply with ASHRAE Standard 62.1 ventilation requirements, keep subsection (a) and delete subsection (b).**

**If the project is to comply with California Title 24 ventilation requirements, keep subsection (b) and delete subsection (a).**

- a. For projects complying with the Ventilation Rate Procedure of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016:
  - 1. The area component of the breathing zone outdoor airflow Vbz-A

*This is the zone floor area times the outdoor airflow rate per unit area, as given in Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.1; i.e., Vbz-A = Az\*Ra.*

2. The population component of the breathing zone outdoor airflow Vbz-P

*This is the zone design population (without diversity) times the outdoor airflow rate per occupant, as given in Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.1; i.e.; Vbz-P = Pz\*Rp.*

- 3. Zone air distribution effectiveness EzH in heating
- 4. Zone air distribution effectiveness EzC in cooling

*Zone air distribution effectiveness depends on the relative locations of supply and return in the space, per ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.2.*

> 5. Indicate where occupied-standby mode is allowed, based on the zone occupancy category per Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.1.

Occupied-standby mode applies to individual zones, is considered a zonal subset of Occupied Mode and is no considered a zone-group operating mode. See Section 5.4.6 for zone-group operating modes.

- For projects complying with California Title 24 ventilation standards:
  - Vocc-min. Zone minimum outdoor airflow for occupants, per California Title 24 prescribed airflow-per-occupant requirements.
  - 2. *Varea-min*. Zone minimum outdoor airflow for building area, per California Title 24 prescribed airflow-per-area requirements.
  - Indicate where occupied-standby mode is allowed based on the zone occupancy category per Title 24-2019, Table 120.1-A.

Occupied-standby mode applies to individual zones, is considered a zonal subset of Occupied Mode, and is not considered a Zone Group Operating Mode. See 5.4.6 for Zone Group Operating Modes.

#### 3.1.1.3. CO<sub>2</sub> Setpoints

Space CO2 setpoints are used for demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) and monitoring/alarming as required by LEED and other green building standards.

It is the designer's responsibility to determine CO2 setpoints. The maximum setpoint varies by ventilation standard Some guidance is provided below for Standard 62.1 and Title 24. The designer may also decide to set lower, more conservative setpoints for improved indoor air quality but at the expense of higher energy use.

Standard 62.1 CO2 Setpoint Guidance

Recommended maximum CO2 is 90% of the steady state concentration per Lawrence<sup>1</sup>

$$CO_2 setpoint = 0.9 \left( C_{OA} + \frac{8400 E_z m}{R_p + R_a A_z / P_z} \right)$$

where COA is the outdoor air CO2 concentration in ppm, Ez is the zone ventilation effectiveness, m is the metabolic rate of occupants, Rp is the people-based component of the ventilation rate, Ra is the area-based component of the ventilation rate, Az is the zone floor area, and Pz is the number of occupants.

The CO2 setpoints in Informative Table 3.1.1.3 assume an ambient concentration of 400 ppm in lieu of using an ambient CO2 sensor. These sequences are based on not having an ambient sensor. This will be conservative in areas with high ambient CO2 concentrations; few areas have lower concentrations.

Setpoints vary by occupancy type, so the easiest way to include this info is by including a column in VAV box and SZ unit schedules and entering the setpoint individually for each zone.

Demand controlled ventilation (DCV) is an active area of research under ASHRAE RP-1747, "Implementation of RP-1547 CO2-Based Demand Controlled Ventilation for Multiple Zone HVAC Systems in Direct Digital Control Systems."

#### California Title 24 CO2 Setpoint Guidance

Title 24 stipulates the setpoint for all occupancies must be 600 ppm above ambient. Ambient concentration may be assumed to be 400 ppm, or an ambient sensor may be provided. These sequences are currently based on not having an ambient sensor, so the CO2 setpoint for all occupancy types is 1000 ppm.

6 ASHRAE Guideline 36-2021

#### 3.1.2. VAV Box Design Information

*For the terminal unit sequences, the engineer must provide the setpoint information in the following subsections, typically on VAV box schedules on drawings.*

#### 3.1.2.1. VAV Cooling-Only Terminal Unit

- a. Zone maximum cooling airflow setpoint (Vcool-max)
- b. Zone maximum heating airflow setpoint (Vheat-max)

*Cooling-only terminal units can provide heat when the AHU supply air temperature is more than 3°C (5°F) above the room temperature. The zone maximum heating airflow setpoint should be set to no more than the zone maximum cooling airflow setpoint. If there is no zone maximum heating airflow setpoint scheduled, set Vheat-max equal to Vcool-max.* 

> c. Zone minimum airflow setpoint (Vmin). This is an optional entry. If no value is scheduled, or a value of "AUTO" is scheduled, Vmin will be calculated automatically and dynamically to meet ventilation requirements.

*In most cases, Vmin should be allowed to be automatically calculated. This ensures compliance with Standard 62.1 and Standard 90.1 prescriptive requirements and with California's Title 24 Energy Standards requirements, and it results in the lowest energy costs.* 

#### 3.1.2.2. VAV Reheat Terminal Unit

- a. Zone maximum cooling airflow setpoint (Vcool-max)
- b. Zone minimum airflow setpoint (Vmin. This is an optional entry. If no value is scheduled, or a value of "AUTO" is scheduled, Vmin will be calculated automatically and dynamically to meet ventilation requirements.

*In most cases, Vmin should be allowed to be automatically calculated. This ensures compliance with Standard 62.1 and Standard 90.1 prescriptive requirements and with California's Title 24 Energy Standards requirements, and it results in the lowest energy costs.* 

c. Zone maximum heating airflow setpoint (Vheat-max)

*The design engineer should set Vheat-max such that the design heating load is met by Vheat-max airflow at a discharge air temperature (DAT) equal to MaxT plus the heating setpoint. MaxT can be no higher than 11°C (20°F) above space temperature setpoint per ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016 (e.g., DAT no more than 32°C [90°F] at 21°C [70°F] space temperature setpoint) for systems supplying air greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) above floor, e.g., ceiling supply systems. Zone air distribution effectiveness EzH can be improved if MaxT is less than 8°C (15°F), provided that the 0.8 m/s (150 fpm) supply air jet reaches to within 1.4 m (4.5 ft) of floor level as indicated in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.2.*

- d. Zone maximum DAT above heating setpoint (MaxT)
- e. The heating minimum airflow setpoint (Vheat-min)

*Vheat-min is the minimum airflow required for reheat coil operation, as is often required of electric resistance coils. It should be as low as possible for best efficiency. For reheat coils with no minimum flow requirement, such as hotwater coils, Vheat-min should be zero.* 

#### 3.1.2.3. Parallel Fan-Powered Terminal Unit, Constant-Volume Fan

a. Zone maximum cooling (primary) airflow setpoint (Vcool-max)

b. Zone minimum primary airflow setpoint (Vmin). This is an optional entry. If no value is scheduled, or a value of "AUTO" is scheduled, Vmin will be calculated automatically and dynamically to meet ventilation requirements.

*In most cases, Vmin should be allowed to be automatically calculated. This ensures compliance with Standard 62.1 and Standard 90.1 prescriptive requirements and with California's Title 24 Energy Standards requirements, and it results in the lowest energy costs.* 

c. Zone maximum DAT above heating setpoint (MaxT)

#### 3.1.2.4. Parallel Fan-Powered Terminal Unit, Variable-Volume Fan

*Fans powered by electronically commutated motors (ECMs) must be programmed with the relationship between control signal and airflow. ECMs can be programmed to control either a specific airflow (with fan curve mapped into logic) or torque (pressure dependent airflow). For these sequences, the ECM fan should be configured for airflow control. This must be addressed by the design engineer in terminal-unit specifications.*

- a. Zone maximum cooling (primary) airflow setpoint (Vcool-max)
- b. Zone minimum primary airflow setpoint (Vmin). This is an optional entry. If no value is scheduled, or a value of "AUTO" is scheduled, Vmin will be calculated automatically and dynamically to meet ventilation requirements.

*In most cases, Vmin should be allowed to be automatically calculated. This ensures compliance with Standard 62.1 and Standard 90.1 prescriptive requirements and with California's Title 24 Energy Standards requirements, and it results in the lowest energy costs.* 

c. Parallel fan maximum heating airflow setpoint (Pfan-htgmax)

*The design engineer should set Pfan-htgmax such that the design heating load is met by the sum of Pfan-htgmax and Vmin at a DAT equal to MaxT plus the heating setpoint. MaxT can be no higher than 11°C (20°F) above space temperature setpoint per ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016 (e.g., DAT no more than 32°C [90°F] at 21°C [70°F] space temperature setpoint) for systems supplying air greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) above floor, e.g., ceiling supply systems. Zone air distribution effectiveness EzH can be improved if MaxT is less than 8°C (15°F), provided that the 0.8 m/s (150 fpm) supply air jet reaches to within 1.4 m (4.5 ft) of floor level as indicated in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016, Table 6.2.2.2. This can be done in most zones by setting Pfan-htgmax to ensure these conditions are maintained.*

- d. Zone maximum DAT above heating setpoint (MaxT)
- 3.1.2.5. Series Fan-Powered Terminal Unit, Constant-Volume Fan
  - a. Zone maximum cooling airflow setpoint (Vcool-max)
  - b. Zone minimum airflow setpoint (Vmin). This is an optional entry. If no value is scheduled, or a value of "AUTO" is scheduled, Vmin will be calculated automatically and dynamically to meet ventilation requirements.

*In most cases, Vmin should be allowed to be automatically calculated. This ensures compliance with Standard 62.1 and Standard 90.1 prescriptive requirements and with California's Title 24 Energy Standards requirements, and it results in the lowest energy costs.* 

*Series fan airflow is not a design variable because it is not controlled. It must be designed and balanced to be equal to or greater than Vcool-max. Typically, the series fan airflow is equal to Vcool-max but may be higher if some blending is desired, such as on cold primary air systems. It may also be higher to improve zone air distribution effectiveness.* 

*The design engineer should set the series fan airflow such that the design heating load is met with a DAT equal to MaxT plus the heating setpoint. MaxT can be no higher than 11°C (20°F) above space temperature setpoint per*
